Whale Ale,"Murray's Whale Ale is a refreshing wheat beer with a twist. Its high percentage of malted and unmalted wheat and aromatic late hop profile gives a unique take on a session strength ale. A classic light body, creamy mouth feel and refreshing citric flavour. This is balanced with assertive late hopping, giving a fresh, light tropical fruit aroma and cleansing dry finish. Murray's Whale Ale is light gold in colour with the traditional cloudy appearance of wheat beers.
